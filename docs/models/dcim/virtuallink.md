# Virtual Links

A virtual link represents a connection between exactly two interfaces. It is somewhat analogous to, and indeed intends to replicate, a "graph edge" found in graph databases, thus allowing for more flexibility in networks.

## Fields

### Interfaces

Select two interfaces: One for side A and one for side B. (Both must be wireless interfaces.)

### Status

The operational status of the link. Options include:

* Connected
* Planned
* Decommissioning
